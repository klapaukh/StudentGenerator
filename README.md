# StudentGenerator

This project aims to generate fake data about students for the purposes of testing visualisation tools. 
The scripts attempt to generate believable students within an engineering program. 

##Data Sources

Name data is sourced from the 1990 census by the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html). The project requires the three files:

 * dist.all.last
 * dist.female.first
 * dist.male.first

##Students

Students are generated having a random name based on the name distribution from the 1990 US census.
